How to reproduce Fig. 4 and SI Fig. 4.

The results of the model are obtained by running Full_SIR_full_0203F4wt.f90 and Full_SIR_full_0203F4sir1.f90. The outputs related to switching rates at different concentration (including estimates) are written onto silence_sir1.dat and silence_wt.dat, while the histograms of histone PTMs before and after replication when switching are stored in rep_histos.dat. The data from Saxton and Rine, 2022, is available in Saxton_2022_2G.csv and Saxton_2022_2H.csv. Given these data, the gnuplot script silencers_titration.plt produces Fig 4 and silencers_titration_SI_est.plt produces SI Fig. 4.
